              She decided to treat it like another workout and trained her social skills like a muscle.
              That's when she met Mario.

              he was never quite able to bring that confidence into his social life. He dated on and off for years,
              but couldn't bring himself to feel like he could settle down. Well, unless he went to a local speed dating
              event and saw a personal trainer that worked at the gym he requented (spoiler: it was Norma!)

              They decided to go to the gym together and that's when everything clicked. After what seemed
              like no time, they decided to become life-long workout partners. That's when Norma had the crazy
              idea to open their own gym and teach others what they figured out. Ten years later of sparring, speaking,
              training, and teaching, the idea doesn't seem so crazy anymore.
