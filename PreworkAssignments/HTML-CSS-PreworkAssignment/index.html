                <!-- About me + hobbies + background section -->
                <p>I hope you're here to talk about Pokemon, manga, or
                    basically any trading card game, because that's what I'm about!
                    <br />
                    Oh, and I guess my wife and three (as of Aug 12th!), too.
                    They're pretty cool, I guess.
                    <br />
                    But hey, you're here for the good stuff, right?
                    Well, you're in luck; having grown up as the middle child
                    of 9 kids, I've seen a pretty wide variety of opinions and
                    hobbies, so I know the good stuff. Stuff like Ed, Edd n Eddy,
                    Megaman Battle Network, Perfect Dark, and Azumanga Daioh.

                <h3>What I'm doing</h3>
                <p>I'm currently working on a few things. Well, okay, other than
                    this bootcamp, I'm working on two things.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li id="nexopedia-li">An unofficial wiki-site for Nexomon (think Bulbapedia 
                        or Serebii, but muuuuuch smaller).
                        <a href="https://github.com/adamschellenberg/nexopedia" target="_blank">
                            Check out the Github repo until the site launches!
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li id="megaman-li">And another unofficial wiki-site. This time, for the
                        Megaman NT Warrior TCG. Never heard of it? Well, that's
                        why I want to build this site. Basically no one has, and
                        it's a shame. Sure, it was only on the market for one year
                        like, 20 years ago, but still! This one is still in the
                        planning phases, so there's no repo yet.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's fun projects like these that push me to keep learning more.
                    After all, if I don't make a website where you can build a deck
                    for a dead tcg, print out proxies, and play with your friends,
                    then who will?!
                </p>
                <p>To see more of whatever random stuff I'm working on, feel free
                    to poke around <a href="https://github.com/adamschellenberg" target="_blank">my Github repos</a><br />
